## About this Project

Beer World!
This application allows you to view multiple beers by using the search bar or sorting them alphabetically. Each beer has displays simple information and a description for each!

## Built With:

This application was built with Vue.js and Vuetify. Vue.js is a simple and clean framework, that's extremely flexible, and can be used for simple to complex applications. I chose Vuetify because its efficient, provides clean, semantic and reusable components that make building an application quick.
