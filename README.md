## About this Project

Beer World!
This application allows you to view multiple beers by using the search bar or sorting them alphabetically. Each beer has displays simple information and a description for each!

## Built With:

This application was built with Vue.js and Vuetify. Vue.js is a simple and clean framework, that's extremely flexible, and can be used for simple to complex applications. I chose Vuetify because its efficient, provides clean, semantic and reusable components that make building an application quick.

## What next:

If I were to make a V2 of this application would have better UX/UI design and more pages to route to. There's a lot of minor things that could be polished and improved, including reviews of beers ( thoughts, comments), a way to sort through types of brews, more in depth details about the beers, and also include more APIs for future features.
